# Overview

I wrote a program that allows an individual to purchase a car and the see how much that car would cost in three different currencies. 
In this program I used atoms, variables, recurrency, mapping and various other elements


The reason I wrote this program was to test what I learned about Kotlin during a two week sprint.


# Development Environment

- I used IntelliJ as the IDE for erlang
- I used youtube as a means to get an overview of the language
- I used Udemdy to gain clarification on aspect of the language that confused me.

# Future Work


* Add the ability to "purchase" the car. Really, what I mean is to view each car individually. Currentyly it shows them all at once.
* Expand the number of cars that it can compare.
* Offer an estimated monthly payment.
